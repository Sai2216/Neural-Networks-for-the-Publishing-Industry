### **Final Documentation & Report**

# **Publishing Industry Analytics & Prediction System**

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Introduction**

### **Project Overview**

The Publishing Industry Analytics & Prediction System aims to provide insights into customer behavior, book demand, and personalized recommendations using machine learning models. This project integrates multiple data sources, performs analysis, and builds predictive models for customer churn and book demand forecasting.

### **Objectives & Goals**

- Predict customer churn to improve retention strategies.
- Forecast book demand to optimize inventory management.
- Provide personalized book recommendations based on order history.
- Develop an interactive **Streamlit** dashboard for visualization.
- Deploy models on **AWS EC2** for real-time predictions.

### **Importance of the Project**

Understanding customer behavior and demand trends helps publishers make data-driven decisions, leading to better sales, reduced costs, and improved customer satisfaction.

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Collection & Preprocessing**

### **Datasets Used**

- **Book Data** (book title, author, ISBN, publisher, etc.)
- **Customer Data** (customer demographics and purchase history)
- **Order Data** (order details, order count, revenue, etc.)

### **SQL Queries**

### **Extracting data from database to dataframe**

```sql

query = """select * from book b 
inner join publisher p on b.publisher_id=p.publisher_id
inner join book_author ba on b.book_id=ba.book_id
inner join author a on a.author_id=ba.author_id
inner join book_language bl on b.language_id=bl.language_id;"""
```

### **Data Cleaning & Transformation**

- **Handling Missing Values**: Replaced NaNs with suitable values.
- **Feature Engineering**: Created **lag features & moving averages** for forecasting.
- **Normalization**: Applied **MinMaxScaler** for model training.

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

### **Key Insights & Visualizations**

- **Top-selling books** based on order count.
- **Customer segmentation** based on spending patterns.
- **Seasonal demand trends** for books.
- **Churn rate analysis** based on order frequency.

**Sample Visualization:** (Include screenshots of charts and graphs.)

## **4Ô∏è‚É£ Model Development**

### **Customer Churn Prediction (ANN Model)**

- **Features Used**: Total Orders, Total Spent, Average Order Value, Days Since Last Order.
- **Model Architecture**:
  - Input Layer ‚Üí Dense Layers (with LeakyReLU activation) ‚Üí Output Layer.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score.

### **Demand Forecasting (LSTM Model)**

- **Features Used**: Order count (with lag variables and moving averages).
- **Model Architecture**:
  - LSTM Layers ‚Üí Dense Layers ‚Üí Output Layer.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: MAE, RMSE.

## **5Ô∏è‚É£ Model Deployment**

### **Steps to Deploy on AWS EC2**

1. **Create EC2 Instance** on AWS.
2. **Transfer trained models** using SCP command:
   ```sh
   scp -i ~/.ssh/bull.pem churn_model_multiclass.h5 ubuntu@<AWS_IP>:/home/ubuntu/
   scp -i ~/.ssh/bull.pem lstm_demand_forecast.h5 ubuntu@<AWS_IP>:/home/ubuntu/
   ```
3. **Install dependencies** on EC2:
   ```sh
   sudo apt update && sudo apt install python3-pip
   pip3 install tensorflow pandas streamlit joblib
   ```
4. **Run Streamlit app on EC2**:
   ```sh
   streamlit run app.py --server.port 8501
   ```

## **6Ô∏è‚É£ Streamlit Application**

### **Features of the Dashboard**

- **Customer Churn Prediction**: Users input customer details to predict churn probability.
- **Demand Forecasting**: Predicts book demand for upcoming months.
- **Personalized Book Recommendations**:
  - **Popular Books** (based on highest orders).
  - **Author-Based Recommendations** (user inputs author name).

## **7Ô∏è‚É£ Challenges & Learnings**

### **Challenges Faced**

- Model input shape mismatches during inference.
- Deployment setup on AWS with permission errors.
- UI enhancements in Streamlit for better interaction.

### **Solutions Implemented**

- Debugged input transformations to match model expectations.
- Ensured proper file transfer using SCP for deployment.
- Improved UI using **Streamlit components & layout optimizations**.

## **8Ô∏è‚É£ Conclusion & Future Scope**

### **Summary of Key Findings**
